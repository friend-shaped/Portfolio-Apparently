UIB Portfolio Project
Objective
Create a personal portfolio website that accurately represents your accomplishments, skill sets, and experience. This portfolio will be the first introduction between you and a prospective hiring manager. Hiring managers are looking for skill and professionality, not irrelevant past experience, excessive personal content, goofy memes, or anything that distracts them from your hireability.

Use this opportunity to create a clean, attractive portfolio that you can use to showcase your abilities as a professional web developer. Keep it direct and helpful.

Requirements
Design, create and deploy your own professional website - demonstrate your proficiency in all of the skills you have learned up to this point

Do not use online templates, JavaScript or any other technologies we have not yet covered in the course - you can always implement new technologies and frameworks in the future

Site should be fully responsive and accessible

Best practices concerning UI/UX need to be adhered to

Before coding anything, establish your workflow and environments (directories, GitHub repo, wireframes, color palette, images)

Have completed portfolio proofread by at least one peer

Dare to be different and make it your own!

What to include:
Profile picture (optional)
Contact information
Working links to relevant social media presence (GitHub, Linkedin)
Links to at least three completed projects
Brief introduction and personal mission statement
What NOT to include:
Links to personal social media accounts
Political / religous content
Remember this is a public facing portfolio, so avoid using silly photos, gamer tags, gifs etc.
Any personal information or opinions unrelated to yourself as a professional and hireable web developer
Presentation
You will be expected to present your portfolio to the class on the last day of the module. Concentrate on explaining your content and design choices, workflow, and discussing any particular difficulties or triumphs.

In the event that you are unable to complete the project, you will still be expected to present your portfolio as a work in progress (WIP).

Your classmates and teachers will be encouraged to ask questions about your project and offer constructive criticism and feedback.

Think of this as an opportunity to present your work as you would in a professional development position or during the hiring process for such a position. Communication skills are important!

Remember, this is not a competition! This is all about mutual support, sharing and positive encouragement.






If you build projects for your GitHub to get a job here's a tip: Build your projects like a professional developer. I wrote a guide on how to do that including 3 projects ideas
Resource
I know a lot of aspiring junior devs struggle to come up with project ideas for their portfolio. But if your goal is to get a job as a developer it's not only about the idea. The way you approach your projects, how you build and present them is at least as important.

That's why I wrote a pretty length blog post about how I would build my portfolio from hindsight. You can find the full blog post here: 3 project ideas + a guide - How to build a React portfolio that gets you a job.

TL;DR: Here a short summary.

The idea behind the blog post is this: If your goal is to get a job you need to convince the hiring managers or developers who review your GitHub projects that you're capable of being part of their team. The best way to prove that is to build projects that are close to real-world apps and build them like a professional developer would. You can find a few ideas for projects in the blog post. But what does it mean to "build them like a professional"?

There are 4 things you want to consider:

Professional workflows. As a developer it's not your job to design an application. But it's your job to turn designs into code. So ideally you find a design and build your app based on that. Additionally don't just start coding right away but make a plan. Look at the design, split it into smaller features and create tasks. Then build the app task by task. You can find designs in the Figma Community and use e.g. a Trello board for your tasks.

Styles. I'd suggest not to use UI frameworks like Material UI. These are nice to work with but often not flexible enough to represent the branding of a company. That's why from my experience most companies use custom CSS. That also forces you to make your app responsive on your own (usually the frameworks take care of most of that).

Application logic. A real-world application has at least routing, state, and data that it fetches. Especially connecting your app to an API and handling/transforming the data is important. That also proves that you can at least use the basic array functions like map, filter or reduce. Btw you don't necessarily need to use Redux for your state management. If you want to stand out (especially as a Junior) add tests to your code. Most Junior projects don't have any so this might be a deciding factor that can get you a job.

Professional Git workflow. This means that you don't only work on the master branch with commit messages like "Fix broken stuff". Create branches, maybe even Pull Requests and use descriptive commit messages.

Apart from the technical stuff it's also important how you present your project. When you look at a GitHub project the first thing that you see (apart from the root file structure) is the README.

So use the README file to introduce the reader (e.g. a hiring manager) to your project. You can find a detailed example README here in the 2nd part of the blog post. To quickly summarize you can add information like

"How I worked on this project" where you describe your workflows (points 1 and 4 above)

"How to navigate this project" where you explain the file structure and link to important parts of the code so the reader doesn't have to poke around (points 2 and 3)

"Why I built the project this way" where you can explain your technical decisions

"If I had more time I would change this" where you can explain what you would improve from hindsight (This can be very powerful since it shows that you can self-reflect and are open to critique)

This way of writing a README not only has the advantage that you guide the reader through the project and your thought process. It also proves that you have communication skills.

Since the READMEs of most portfolio projects suck this is a great way to stand out from other job applicants. If you want more details you can get a template to base your READMEs on here.

I hope this information is useful to someone. If you have feedback or any thoughts I'd be happy about your comments. If you want more information read the blog post obviously :)# Portfolio-Apparently
