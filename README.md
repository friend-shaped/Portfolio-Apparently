# UIB Portfolio Project

**Objective**

As part of my DCI curriculum I was tasked with creating a personal portfolio to showcase my projects. 

We had three class days to work on this assignment, and I spent most of them looking at other developer portfolios in design decision paralysis. 

I tried to pre-plan a mock-up in Figma in accordance with a classmate's advice, but that's not a way that I'm able to brainstorm and plan. Instead, I wrote rough ideas for my structure and design plans in commented out notes.

Once I found and settled on an image from my camera roll to base my color palette and design around, it was easy to implement the structure I had already planned in my comments.

I look forward to being able to evolve and streamline this thing as my skills expand. Thanks for reading and taking a look!
